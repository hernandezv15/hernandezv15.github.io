Victoria (Tori) Hernandez graduated with a B.S. in Communication Sciences and Disorders with a minor in American Sign Language from The University of Texas at Austin. During her undergraduate studies, she worked full-time as a nanny and was very involved with the Latinx Community Affairs in the Multicultural Engagement Center. She worked in the sign language research lab and this was her first introduction to data science and analysis. She decided to pursue a Masters in Data Science at SMU because of the machine learning and natural language processing. She is currently working at IODrx as an EMR coordinator and Junior Data Analyst.
